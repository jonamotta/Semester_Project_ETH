Testing Lepton Flavour Universality in semi-leptonic decays of the Bc meson: a feasibility study in CMS.

The two ROOT files are the MCs of the events that we want to study

Event_scan and feature_distribs are two programs to look into the ROOT files and see how the MCs are made

The folder VARIUOS NNs contains various naural network used to obtain the final selection NN. They are various steps 
and varipus ideas, some usefull and some not. They are not effectively useful to the final understanding of the project

The folder TEST_ENV contains a specific NN usefull to compare different features selections in order to get the best 
discrimination power possible

The folder SELECTION_NN contains the most updated selection neural network that gives the best discrimination power.
This NN is the 'only' one necessary to understand how the project is working
